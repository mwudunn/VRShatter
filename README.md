Virtual Reality game developed in Unity to demonstrate complex and physically-accurate shattering effects by pre-computing. In the game, blocks fall from the sky in preset locations along a half-circle. The player must prevent the blocks from stacking too high by aligning cubes of the same color either vertically or horizontally. To do so, the player is given a projectile which changes the color of a block that it hits in a cyclical way. Additionally, some cubes are made of glass which shatter when the projectile collides with it, causing blocks above it to fall.

In total, 5 different animations for the shattering effect of the glass cube were pre-computed, 1 for a projectile passing through the center of the cube, and 4 for a projectile colliding near each of the 4 corners. At runtime, when a projectile collided with a cube, the animation which best matched the projectile's location was used, giving the illusion that a complex shattering effect was occuring in real-time.
